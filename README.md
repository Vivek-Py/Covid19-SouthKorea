# Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*

# Project Motivation
For this project, I was interestested in using CoVid-19 data from March 2020 to better understand:
1. Which are the most affected areas in South Korea?
2. What was the mode of infection & where patient got it from?
3. What are death rates of both genders?
4. Is there any correlation between the temperature and the confirmed cases?
The full set of files related to this project are owned by Kaggle, so they are publicly available. However, you can see pieces of the analysis here.

# File Descriptions
There are 4 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. No Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

There are additional .csv file that were used for analysis.

# Licensing, Authors, & Acknowledgements
